Models pre-trained are available here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/129uGZ0P8uAIr4rGbLuZmc40LpUzzWMB1/view?usp=sharing

_Make sure to put them in ./models folder._

**All commands must be done from the root path mlrf/>**

### Python setup 

First, you will have to install python and setup a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Then you will be able to activate it and install packages :
```bash
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Compute all

```bash
python ./src/process_all.py
```

### In depth commands

#### Data part

First let's download the data :
```bash
python ./src/data/get.py
```

You can then retreat it to make a temporary dataset :

- `train_batches=5`: Train batches amount to take

```bash
python ./src/data/make.py --train_batches=5
```

Let's have a look of what data looks like images in the train set.

- `label=0` : Images with this label will be displayed
- `amount=9` : Size of tile (9 means 81 images)

```bash
python ./src/visualization/mosaic.py --label=5 --amount=500
```

_All figures are saved in ./reports/figures_

You can also visualize labels repartition :

- `dataset=train` : Display train or test dataset.

```bash
python ./src/visualization/repartition.py
```

#### Features part

Now you can process features. You can compute Flatten, HOG and LBP :

- `features=all` : Choose features to build ex : flatten,hog

```bash
python ./src/features/build.py
```

To check features correlation :
```bash
python ./src/visualization/corr.py
```

#### Models training

Build and train your models :

- `hyper_params={"svm": {"tol": 1e-4, "C": 1.0, "max_iter": 50}, "k-means": {"n_neighbors": 10}, "xg-boost": {"max_depth": 15, "epochs": 50, "learning_rate": 0.1}}` : Dictionary of hyper-parameters
- `override=False` : Override model, else doesn't compute it

```bash
python ./src/models/train.py
```

leaf_size for KMeans will be adjusted with DE algorithm. 

_Notice it will display loss history for XG-Boost model_

#### Models testing

You can now tests your models to get performance metrics. Each test will be save with date as key in ./reports/results

- `delete_hist=False`: Remove results history

```bash
python ./src/models/test.py
```

_If you have downloaded pre-trained models and set override to False, it will not compute them._

After models testing, you have a look on figures :

```bash
python ./src/visualization/performances.py
```

#### Additional commands

- Clean interim data

```bash
python ./src/data/clean.py
```
